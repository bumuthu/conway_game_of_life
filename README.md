Python implementation of Conway Game of Life


![This is Conway Game of Life implementation using python](https://github.com/bumuthu/conway_game_of_life/blob/master/images/game_of_life.PNG)


Here I have used matplotlib library for visualization apart from python standard libraries. 
You may use a virtual environment for running.

Got to the project directory and run 

```python main.py```

Thank you !
